        <h1>WEIRD ROUTINE STUFF + JANK CREATIVITY</h1>
        <p>
          I am obsessed with my daily routine.
          I also try to apply creativity to my daily problems and the results often vary.
          Here's the list of weird stuff I have tried!

        <h1>Polyphasic Sleep</h1>
        <h3>Backstory</h3>
        <p>
          I stumbled across this concept when one semester my class schedule was particularly fragmented. My friend upon hearing about how I would often nap around the day mentioned how it sounded similar to a cat-nap cycle. Intrigued, I searched the internet for more information when I came across this <a href="https://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/uberman-2/" target="_blank"> website.</a>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            Essentially, the claim of polyphasic sleep (multiple sleeps in the span of 24 hours), is that by splitting
            up your sleep, you can reduce the overall time of sleep during every 24 hours while still feeling just as refreshed. The Everyman, one of the most popular polyphasic sleep cycles involves a fairly long sleep during the night and a much lighter nap during the day. In fact, many people already do this without knowing so! Also, there have been famous polyphasic sleepers throughout history such as Thomas Edison and Leonardo Da Vinci.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Why try it</h3>
        <p>
             During the time, I was having trouble balancing my school/work/relaxation so the idea of 6 extra hours everyday seemed like a dream come true! Furthermore, according to some online sources, after quitting a long routine of polyphasic sleep, people gain the ability to fall asleep instantly!
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Set-up</h3>
        <p>
          I was incredibly excited to begin this experiment, however, it took me a few days to really commit to the idea.  I hated sacrificing efficiency for willpower so I decided against doing the easier and less painful Everyman Sleep Cycle and I instead chose to to the Uberman. Overall, the amount of sleep someone gets during the Uberman is from around 2-3 hours every 24 hours gained from several 15 minute naps scattered throughout the day. I pulled-an all-nighter before I was going to start, in order to jump-start myself into the cycle. Apparently, it takes a month for the body to adapt to the lack of sleep and start to really utilize the 15-minute cat-naps. All I had to do was make it to 30 days...
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          It was one of the worst times of my life.
          <br><br>
          On Day 1/Night 1, the 15 minute naps were completely useless. I would jump in bed, set my alarm, think about falling asleep and then the alarm would ring. However, I had stuff to do. Throughout the day, I got way more stuff studied and during the night I watched a couple movies and played a few games.
          <br><br>
          Day 2 also was not so bad, although, waking up got harder and harder. I started to get a voice in my head telling me to quit. It was so hard not to quit and my thoughts for quitting became more reasonable and tempting every time I got up from a nap. There was constant swirling and clashing with the thoughts I had locked into my brain before the experiment telling me to stay on the routine and the ones I was experiencing at that time.
          <br><br>
         I expected the incredible boredom before I started the trial as there were plenty of tips online and so I had compiled a list of things I wanted to do: Play games, watch movies, make music, read books, study, etc... However, what I did not expect was the state of mind I would be in. I felt completely lethargic.
          <br><br>
          Finally, on Day 3 I got sick. This is what happens to most people during the Uberman. The body can not cope with the lack of rest and its defenses start to weaken. The first cat-nap after getting sick, I set my alarm as usual, went to bed and sadly awaited the ring of my alarm. I woke up 16 hours later. I don't even remember my alarm going off. After happily realizing I had failed, I lied back in bed and slept for another 4 hours.
          <br><br>
          Overall the whole experience sort of felt like being on a long 24+ hour flight: constant grogginess, boredom and a longing to be back in bed. It made me respect my sleep a lot more and the semester which followed saw me getting 9+ hours of sleep every night. I never wanted to be sleep deprived again (and still never do to this day). What was the point of all the extra time, when all I could to do was stare at my computer screen and dream about the next 15 minute nap.
